            <p>MennoHost was created and is run by me, Bryce Yoder, a software engineer, web developer, and graphic designer living in Lancaster PA. <i>A little about me:</i></p>

            <p>I grew up in Lancaster county, attending East Chestnut Street Mennonite Church and Lancaster Mennonite High School. I went to Goshen College after graduating and worked as a System Administrator at Mennonite.net, the proto-MennoHost organization. After Mennonite.net closed, I felt that its mission and purpose was still relevant, and that its closure was a loss for the broader church. MennoHost exists to fill the gap that was left and provide affordable, reliable hosting for Mennonite organizations, and—crucially—free hosting for small sites run by individuals.</p>

            <p >Aside from running MennoHost, I am now a DevOps Engineer at Moodle, and have returned to Lancaster city. My wife and I attend James Street Mennonite Church.</p><br />

            <h2>Tech stack</h2>
            <p>MennoHost is built on Linode, an affordable cloud hosting provider. All of the servers run Ubuntu, and MySQL is used for both internal databases as well as hosted WordPress sites. Traffic is load-balanced between multiple web servers via HAProxy. NGINX is used to serve web pages, and certificates are provided by LetsEncrypt.
